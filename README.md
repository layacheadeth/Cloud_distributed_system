This Repository has our final project, Amplify React Application.

Go to **master node** and **new_nod**e for more information.

This is a cloud project which Ellish and I work together on.

The webapp is basically a mini music webapp we created using AWS framework. 

The music webapp can upload music, play the uploaded music, delete music, like and comment music, with necessary authentication to secure the app as well.
